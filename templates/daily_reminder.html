        This is an auto-generated mail to remind you that you have {{data.incomplete}} tasks incomplete and
        {{data.overdue}} are over-due among them.
        {% if data.overdue == 0 %}
        Keep it up 👍.
        {% else %}
        <strong>Try to complete them as soon as possible.</strong>
        {% endif %}
